## This is a diagram of an storage managing app for a coffee shop. 

### My wife runs one a small restaurant and they always have some problema managing the storage.
### They use Google sheets for that, but the problem is that it has no log of who changed what, so
### the never know if a sale was already updated to the sheet or not.
### My idea was then to try to do something similar to github, where you stage the changes first,
### and you can consolidate the changes later. In this way it is really fast to register, whenever a sales occur,
### but you can compare all the latest changes staged before consolidating them to the database. I believe this will make it easier
### for them to spot duplicate and missing entries.

### I never used draw.io so I do not think I did the best possible with it. But I can come back and improve the charts after feedback.
